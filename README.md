## Usage
For now the Python API is very simple and just creates a window with a hardcoded stress test.

```python
import guilible as gl

win = gl.Window()
win.start()
```

## Building wheels
Eventually we will build the Rust code in CI and publish Python wheels, for this the maturin-generated CI script will be a good starting point: `maturin generate-ci github`

For now we can locally build the wheel simply by running `pip install -e .` in the repository root.

## Development setup
We can use the [`maturin_import_hook`](https://www.maturin.rs/import_hook) package to automatically build the Rust code when there are changes. Run this once per virutal environment:
```bash
pip install maturin_import_hook
python -m maturin_import_hook site install
```
Importing the package will now automatically build the Rust code.
